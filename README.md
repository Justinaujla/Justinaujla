## Hey there 👋, I'm `Justin` (he/him)

#### Welcome to my corner of the internet! ☕

#### I'm a curious innovator with a passion in ***accessible tech*** 🦾⚡. On campus, you can find me in the library 📚 or working on the university's hyperloop team <img alt="team-waterloop-logo" src="./assets/waterloop-logo.png" width="21px" height="12px">. Outside of campus I'm constantly working on personal projects 🚧 and mentoring youth about entering the industry 👨🏽‍🏫. In my free time I'm an avid audiophile 🎧 and painter 🎨. I'm not afraid to learn, take risks, and do what other say I can't 🦸‍♂️. I've been working to mitigate the difficulties that the people in my community face because of their disabilities through the use of technology 💡. Come along and watch my journey as I make the world more accessible to people of all abilities 🌎❤!
